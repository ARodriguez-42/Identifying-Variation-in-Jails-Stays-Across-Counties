# Overview
Welcome to our group's capstone project! Our primary objective was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of incarcerations across 35 different California counties. We developed a robust data pipeline tailored for sponsors to utilize in their future research endeavors. Throughout this project, we delved into various aspects of the incarceration landscape, including overlapping stays, length of stays, and time intervals between incarcerations.

### Key Features

* Data Pipeline: We meticulously crafted a data pipeline that streamlines the analysis process, offering sponsors a powerful tool for their ongoing research efforts
* XGBoost Model: Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we implemented an XGBoost model to identify key factors influencing incarceration trends. This model provides valuable insights for understanding and predicting patterns within the dataset.
* Census Integration: To enrich our analysis, we incorporated additional data from the Census for each county. This augmentation allowed us to identify socio-economic trends that may contribute to the patterns observed in the incarceration data.
* Tableau Visualization: Our findings and trends are presented using Tableau, offering an intuitive and visually appealing platform for exploring the data. The interactive visualizations enhance the user experience and facilitate a deeper understanding of the insights gained.
